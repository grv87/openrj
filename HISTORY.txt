Open-RJ - History
-----------------


  26th September 2006 - Open-RJ 1.6.2 released

    general:
      ~ fix for Visual C++ 8.0 makefile(s)

    core library:
      + addition of ORJ_PARSE_INVALIDFIELDNAME flag
      ~ corrected bug in parsing; an empty field name now results
              in parse error (ORJ_PARSE_INVALIDFIELDNAME)

    Open-RJ/.NET:
      + Added Database.ParseErrorCode.InvalidFieldName flag

    Open-RJ/STL:
      + updated support for field iterators for Digital Mars
              C/C++ compiler (openrj/stl/database.hpp).


  20th September 2006 - Open-RJ 1.6.1 released

    general:
      + support for Visual C++ 8.0 makefile(s)

    core library:
      + support for ORJ_FLAG_FORCEALLFIELDSINTO1RECORD flag
      ~ strings now avoids any runtime cost for length evaluation

    Open-RJ/.NET:
      + Support for ForceAllFieldsIntoOneRecord flag

    Open-RJ/Python:
      + support for FORCE_ALL_FIELDS_INTO_1_RECORD flag

    Open-RJ/Ruby:
      + support for FORCE_ALL_FIELDS_INTO_1_RECORD flag


  9th August 2006 - Open-RJ 1.5.3 released

    Open-RJ/.NET:
      ~ Corrected bug in Database class, whereby the Fields property
        actually returned a collection of Record instances, rather than
        Field instances.
      + new single-parameter constructor for FileDatabase, which
        assumes ElideBlankRecords
      + new single-parameter constructor for MemoryDatabase, which
        assumes ElideBlankRecords


  26th July 2006 - Open-RJ 1.5.2 released

    general:
      ~ Minor changes to Open-RJ/C++ and Open-RJ/STL to reflect changes
        to STLSoft libraries directory structure.

    Open-RJ/.NET:
      + Record.GetFieldValue() method overloads

    Open-RJ/Ruby:
      + Database.records property
      + Database.fields property


  28th May 2006 - Open-RJ 1.5.1 released

    core library:
      + field name aliases
      + case-insensitive field lookups
      + ORJ_Database_GetFieldA()

    Open-RJ/C++:
      + Lookup() function (openrj/cpp/functions.hpp)

    Open-RJ/STL:
      + field_assoc_insert_iterator class (openrj/stl/iterator.hpp).

    Open-RJ/.NET:
      + Fields collection class
      + Record.Comment property
      + Record.HasField()
      + Record.GetNamedFields()
      + Database.Flags enumeration
      + Database.ErrorCode enumeration
      + Database.ParseErrorCode enumeration
      + Database.Fields property
      + Database.GetNamedFields()

    Open-RJ/Python:
      + IGNORE_CASE_ON_LOOKUP
      + NO_REINTERPRET_FIELD_IDS

    Open-RJ/Ruby:
      + IGNORE_CASE_ON_LOOKUP
      + NO_REINTERPRET_FIELD_IDS

    + eight C examples
    + six C++ examples
    + seven STL examples


  8th August 2005 - Open-RJ 1.4.1 released

    core:

      + ORJ_FormatErrorA(), rich error formatting function
      + ORJ_Record_FindNextFieldA(), a flexible function for finding fields
        based on field positions and/or names and/or values.


  15th July 2005 - Open-RJ 1.3.4 released

    core:
      ~ BUG FIX: Now handles cr+lf irrespective of operating system.


  28th June 2005 - Open-RJ 1.3.3 released

    core:
      ~ BUG FIX: fixed an assert in orjapi.c, which erroneously fired when
        a record marker had trailing whitespace.
      + Compatible with Mac OS-X
      + added c_str_ptr_null and c_str_data string access shims, for
        ::openrj, ::openrj::cpp and ::openrj::stl constructs.

    Open-RJ/C++:
      + openrj::cpp::Record now uses Static Covariance (aka
        Argument-dependent Covariance) for subscript operator. This means
        that if it's an integer then a Field is returned, and if it's a
        string then the value (as a string) is returned.

    Open-RJ/STL:
      + reverse iterator support in the record and database classes of the
        STL mapping.


  26th May 2005 - Open-RJ 1.3.2 released

    Open-RJ/C++:
    Open-RJ/STL:
      + The Record/record classes, in the Open-RJ/C++ and Open-RJ/STL
        mappings respectively, now return const Field/field instances, to
        prevent misuse in the following form:

          record[0] = record[1]; // Will now not compile

    Open-RJ/C++:
      + The Record class has enhanced subscript operators to prevent
        ambiguous resolution when used with literal integers.


  23rd May 2005 - Open-RJ 1.3.1 released

    core:
      + record comments are now made available through the API.
      + implicit link header

    Open-RJ/C++:
      ~ the database classes are now separated out into individual headers
      + (in)equality operators for Field class
      + Record::GetComment()
      + Record::HasFieldWithValue()

    Open-RJ/STL:
      + record::get_comment()

    Open-RJ/Python:
      + comment attribute on record class

    Open-RJ/Ruby:
      + comment attribute on record class


  4th March 2005 - Open-RJ 1.2.1 released

      core:
        + ORJ_CreateDatabaseFromMemoryA() - facilitates reading databases
          from memory
        + ORJ_GetErrorStringA()
        + ORJ_GetParseErrorStringA()

    Open-RJ/C++:
      + FileDatabase class
      + MemoryDatabase class

    Open-RJ/STL:
      ~ the classes are now separated out into individual headers


  29th September 2004 - Open-RJ 1.0.1 released

    initial release
